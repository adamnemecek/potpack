# potpack

This is a Rust port of the potpack algorithm for packing 2D rectangles.

[Original JS implementation](https://github.com/mapbox/potpack)

As mentioned in the original implementation README, is not the most optimal algorithm (it might waste like 7% of your texture), however it's very simple and fast.
